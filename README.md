Founded Issues: <br/>
Airdrop / Sidecar not working, can be found but unable to connect <br/>
HDMI external display can always be detected once plugged in, but sometimes the graphic signal is not transferring <br/>
Sometimes wake up from sleep will cause green screen and no responding, restart to solve. <br/>
 <br/>
Everything else works fine as usual. <br/>
Turn off Secure Boot before booting. <br/>
Plug your USB installer and enjoy <br/>
