Founded Issues:
Airdrop / Sidecar not working, can be found but unable to connect
HDMI external display can always be detected once plugged in, but sometimes the graphic signal is not transferring
Sometimes wake up from sleep will cause green screen and no responding, restart to solve.

Everything else works fine as usual.
Turn off Secure Boot before booting.
Plug your USB installer and enjoy
